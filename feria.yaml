flags:
  # (Debug) Prints all assets at startup. Keep in mind that they are all loaded at startup anyways for caching purposes, this flag only prints them on screen
  #- e-startup-print-assets

  # (Dangerous) Access directly as root in the same machine the server is running. This is useful if you want to run SHLED only as a desktop application completely offline or in a small local network that you trust
  - e-root-local-autologin
